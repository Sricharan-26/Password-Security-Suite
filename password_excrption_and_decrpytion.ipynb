        "# Password Strength Check\n",
        "\n",
        "This project evaluates the strength of a password based on various criteria and provides feedback. Below is a simple explanation of how the code works:\n",
        "\n",
        "### Key Points\n",
        "\n",
        "### **1. Using Gradio for Web Interface**\n",
        "   - **Gradio** is used to create a user-friendly web interface for the password checker.\n",
        "   - The interface includes input fields for the password and a checkbox to toggle the visibility of the entered password.\n",
        "\n",
        "### **2. Password Input Handling**\n",
        "   - A **textbox** is provided for users to input their password (`password_input`).\n",
        "   - A **checkbox** (`show_password`) toggles between showing or hiding the password characters.\n",
        "   - When the password changes, or the visibility toggles, the program evaluates the password strength in real-time.\n",
        "   - All the entered passwords are saved in password.txt file\n",
        "\n",
        "### **3. Evaluating Password Strength**\n",
        "   - The function `check_password_strength` uses **regular expressions** to assess specific password criteria:\n",
        "     - **Length:** Checks if the password is at least 8 characters long and gives additional points for 12+ characters.\n",
        "     - **Uppercase Letters:** Verifies the presence of uppercase letters (e.g., `A-Z`).\n",
        "     - **Lowercase Letters:** Verifies the presence of lowercase letters (e.g., `a-z`).\n",
        "     - **Numbers:** Checks if the password contains digits (`0-9`).\n",
        "     - **Special Characters:** Looks for special characters (e.g., `!@#$%^&*`).\n",
        "\n",
        "### **4. Calculating Password Strength**\n",
        "   - The password strength is scored out of 6 based on the above criteria.\n",
        "   - A **percentage** is calculated for the score, representing the strength:\n",
        "     - **Weak (0-33%)**: Red meter.\n",
        "     - **Moderate (34-66%)**: Orange meter.\n",
        "     - **Strong (67-100%)**: Green meter.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "### Benefits\n",
        "- Helps users create strong and secure passwords.\n",
        "- Provides detailed feedback for improvement.\n",
        "- Interactive and easy to use.\n"

        "### 1. **Symmetric Encryption**\n",
        "- **Definition**: A cryptographic technique where the same key is used for both encrypting and decrypting data.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Uses the `Fernet` class from the `cryptography` library to implement symmetric encryption.\n",

        "### 2. **Encryption**\n",

        "  1. Converts plaintext data (e.g., passwords) into ciphertext using an encryption algorithm and a secret key.\n",
        "  2. Ciphertext is unreadable without the key.\n",
        "- **Purpose**:\n",
        "  - Protects sensitive data by ensuring it cannot be read without decryption.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "### 3. **Decryption**\n",
        "- **Process**:\n",
        "  1. Converts ciphertext back into readable plaintext using the same secret key.\n",
        "  2. This process reverses encryption.\n",
        "- **Requirement**:\n",
        "  - The original secret key is necessary to perform decryption.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "### 4. **Role of the Secret Key**\n",

        "  1. **Encryption**: Encodes plaintext into ciphertext securely.\n",
        "  2. **Decryption**: Decodes ciphertext back to plaintext.\n",
        "- **Security Dependency**:\n",
        "  - If the key is lost, encrypted data cannot be decrypted.\n",
        "  - If the key is compromised, encrypted data becomes vulnerable.\n",
        "\n",

        "\n",
        "### 5. **File Handling**\n",
        "- Files are used to store:\n",
        "  - **Input Data**: Plaintext passwords (`password.txt`).\n",
        "  - **Encrypted Data**: Encrypted passwords (`encrypted_passwords.txt`).\n",
        "  - **Decrypted Data**: Plaintext passwords retrieved after decryption (`decrypted_passwords.txt`).\n",

        "3. **Convenience**:\n",
        "   - Automates encryption and decryption processes for efficient data handling.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Data Integrity**:\n",
        "   - Ensures that encrypted data cannot be tampered with without detection.\n",

        "\n",
        "## **Limitations**\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Key Management**:\n",
        "   - Losing the secret key results in permanent loss of encrypted data.\n",
        "   - Hackers can decrypt the data if the secret key is known to the hackers\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Single Point of Failure**:\n",
        "   - If the key is compromised, all encrypted data becomes vulnerable.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Performance Overhead**:\n",
        "   - Encrypting and decrypting large datasets can take time.\n",

        "- **Purpose**:\n",
        "  - Hashing passwords ensures that even if the data is compromised, plaintext passwords cannot be retrieved.\n",
        "- **Usage**:\n",
        "  - Hashes are stored instead of plaintext passwords, and during authentication, the hash of the input password is compared with the stored hash.\n",

        "## **Benefits of Hashing**\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Irreversibility**:\n",
        "   - Hashing is a one-way operation. Original input cannot be derived from the hash.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Fixed-Size Output**:\n",
        "   - Regardless of input size, hashing algorithms produce a fixed-length hash.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Efficiency**:\n",
        "   - Hashing algorithms are computationally efficient for processing data.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Integrity Checking**:\n",
        "   - Useful for verifying data integrity (e.g., checksums).\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **Scalability**:\n",
        "   - Hashes can be generated for any size of input data.\n",

        "\n",
        "## **Limitations of Hashing**\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Not Encryption**:\n",
        "   - Hashing is irreversible, unlike encryption, which allows for decryption back to the original data.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Vulnerable Algorithms**:\n",
        "   - Older algorithms like MD5 and SHA-1 are vulnerable to collision attacks (different inputs producing the same hash).\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Brute Force Attacks**:\n",
        "   - Hashes are susceptible to brute force or dictionary attacks if the input space is small.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Lack of Salt**:\n",
        "   - Hashes without added randomness (salt) are vulnerable to rainbow table attacks.\n",
